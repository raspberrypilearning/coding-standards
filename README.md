Raspberry Pi Foundation Learning Team Coding Standards

These standards outline what we (RPF learning team) consider best practice when writing code for young people who are learning to program. They focus on consistency and clarity for learners, reducing cognitive load and avoiding approaches that may lead to misconceptions. 
- These standards should be followed by all content writers across all our learning products
- We should follow these standards in all code examples we write
- In situations where following these standards is challenging, please discuss with #learning-team via slack.

These standards were last reviewed in March 2025, to suggest additions / improvments please edit, commit changes and create a new branch & pull request
